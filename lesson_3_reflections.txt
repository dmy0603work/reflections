When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
- If you need to share your work with others or work on your project from more than one location/computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you might not want or be ready for changes made by others in your specific branch.  If you are using a branch to build a new feature in isoliation, you probably don't care about other changes during development.  


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
- a fork is a copy of someone else's repository made on the GitHub servers.  This allows you to make changes to the forked repository (your copy) even if you are not allowed to make changes to the source (other person's repo)
- a clone of a repository is a copy of a repository on your local computer.  The source can be either a repo on GitHub or another repo on your local computer.
- a branch exists is a label added to the commit history at a point in time that allows you to make changes in isoloation.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
- this allows you to perform git log and git diff to compare/understand these changes in your local branch.
